- Select your institute (chances are that it is Delft University of Technology) and login with your credentials and (likely) a second factor.

- Select the tab "Collaborations" and then the line "TU Delft iRods". If this is your first encounter with SRAM, it is likely that you are enrolled in only one collaboration.

- Click on the tab "Service tokens" and then on the button "Create service token"

- Make sure you copy the service token that is displayed in to your password manager (you do have one right?) and give the token a name and then click "Save". After clicking save you will never be able to retrieve the actual token again (if you forget it you can create a new one).
